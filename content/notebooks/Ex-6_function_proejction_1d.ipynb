    "# Function projection in a MW basis\n",

    "There are two equivalent representations of a function using multiwavets: the *compressed* representation and the *reconstructed* representation. The fisrt one employs the scaling functions at the coarsest scale $N_0$ (defined by the domain of the problem) and the wavelet functions at all successive scales $n = N_0, \\ldots N_{max}$. The second one employs the scaling functions at scale $N_{max}+1$\n",

    "Compressed representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) \\simeq \\sum_i s^{N_0}_i \\phi^0_i(x) + \\sum_{n=N_{min}}^{N_{max}} \\sum_l \\sum_i d^n_{il} \\psi^n_{il}(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Reconstructed representation:\n",

    "$$s^n_{il} = \\left\\langle f(x)|\\phi^n_{il}(x) \\right\\rangle$$\n",

    "Some practical considerations:\n",
    "- The scaling coefficients $s$ are obtained by a simple quadrature scheme, often using the natural quadrature points ($x_\\mu$) and weights ($\\omega_\\mu$) of the chosen polynomial basis\n",
    "  * $s^n_{il} \\approx \\sum_\\mu w_\\mu \\phi^n_{il}(x) f(x_\\mu)$\n",
    "  * If computed in this manner, the coefficients will only be accurate if the function $f(x)$ is sufficiently smooth in that box.  Indeed, if the function $f(x)$ has fine-scale structure that falls between the numerical quadrature points, the computed values can be completely wrong.\n",
    "  * Thus, adaptive refinement needs to be performed carefully and with the awareness that computationally viable approaches are just heuristics that can sometimes fail.\n",
    "- The wavelet coefficients $d$ are obtained by computing the scaling coeffients at the next finest scale and then employing the two-scale relationship.  Doing this recursively up the tree performs the wavelet transform.\n",
    "- The compressed representation shows how the scaling coefficients are used only at the coarsest scale whereas the wavelet coefficients are used at all subsequent scales\n",
    "- The sum over the translation indices $l$ includes all nodes present at the given scale. In an *adaptive* representation the tree structure is locally terminated based on precision requirements\n",
    "- The reconstructed representation (here shown for a *uniform* grid) is performed at scale $N_{max}+1$. \n",
    "- The compressed and reconstructed representations have the same number of coefficients.\n",
